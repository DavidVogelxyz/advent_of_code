## Part 1

Explanation of the code that solves part 1:

### Creating the grid

```
let grid = input
    .trim()
    .lines()
    .map(|line| line
        .trim()
        .chars()
        .collect::<Vec<_>>())
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

First, input is separated into lines:

- Those lines are separated into individual chars:
    - Each char is an element of a Vec (representing a line).
- Then, each line (Vec) becomes an element of a second Vec.
- Therefore, to reference a value:
    - The first index designates the line.
    - The second index designates the column.

### Beginning of the nested for loops

```
for row in 0.. grid.len() {
    for col in 0.. grid[row].len() {
        let value = grid[row][col];

        if !value.is_ascii_digit() {
            continue
        }
```

For each column in each row:

- If not a digit, go to the next column

### Flagging adjacent symbols

```
for row_offset in -1..=1 {
    for col_offset in -1..=1 {
        if row_offset == 0 && col_offset == 0 {
            continue
        }

        let adj_row = row as i32 + row_offset;
        let adj_col = col as i32 + col_offset;

        if adj_row < 0
            || adj_row >= grid.len() as i32
                || adj_col < 0
                || adj_col >=grid[adj_row as usize].len() as i32
        {
            continue
        }

        let adj_value = grid[adj_row as usize][adj_col as usize];
        if !adj_value.is_ascii_digit() && adj_value != '.' {
            has_adj_sym = true;
        }
    }
}
```

For each of the nine adjacent positions:

- Skip if self (row_offset & col_offset both equal 0)
- If off-grid above (adj_row < 0) or to left (adj_col < 0), skip
- If off-grid below or to right (>=...len() as i32), skip
    - This works because "equal to" account for indexing
- If not off-grid, `adj_value` equals value of that adj character
- `adj_value` is a symbol if `adj_value` is not:
    - a digit
    - a `.`
- when `adj_value` is a symbol, the flag gets set

### Creating the sum

```
curr_num *= 10;
curr_num += value.to_digit(10).unwrap();

if col + 1 >= grid[row].len() || !grid[row][col + 1].is_ascii_digit() {
    if has_adj_sym {
        sum += curr_num;
    }

    curr_num = 0;
    has_adj_sym = false;
}
```

Then, math happens:

- The first time a digit gets through, `0 * 10 = 0`
- Any other time after the first, the `curr_num` is shifted by an order of ten
    - Then, `value` is added to `curr_num`
- The for loops keep doing this until either:
    - end of line
    - not a digit
- If the flag is set, `curr_num` is added to the running sum

This is performed on all lines, until the end of the file. Then, the sum is returned.
