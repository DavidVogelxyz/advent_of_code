## Part 1

Explanation of the code that solves part 1:

### Creating the grid

```
let grid = input
    .trim()
    .lines()
    .map(|line| line
        .trim()
        .chars()
        .collect::<Vec<_>>())
    .collect::<Vec<_>>();
```

First, input is separated into lines:

- Those lines are separated into individual chars:
    - Each char is an element of a Vec (representing a line).
- Then, each line (Vec) becomes an element of a second Vec.
- Therefore, to reference a value:
    - The first index designates the line.
    - The second index designates the column.

### Beginning of the nested for loops

```
for row in 0.. grid.len() {
    for col in 0.. grid[row].len() {
        let value = grid[row][col];

        if !value.is_ascii_digit() {
            continue
        }
```

For each column in each row:

- If not a digit, go to the next column

### Flagging adjacent symbols

```
for row_offset in -1..=1 {
    for col_offset in -1..=1 {
        if row_offset == 0 && col_offset == 0 {
            continue
        }

        let adj_row = row as i32 + row_offset;
        let adj_col = col as i32 + col_offset;

        if adj_row < 0
            || adj_row >= grid.len() as i32
                || adj_col < 0
                || adj_col >=grid[adj_row as usize].len() as i32
        {
            continue
        }

        let adj_value = grid[adj_row as usize][adj_col as usize];
        if !adj_value.is_ascii_digit() && adj_value != '.' {
            has_adj_sym = true;
        }
    }
}
```

For each of the nine adjacent positions:

- Skip if self (row_offset & col_offset both equal 0)
- If off-grid above (adj_row < 0) or to left (adj_col < 0), skip
- If off-grid below or to right (>=...len() as i32), skip
    - This works because "equal to" account for indexing
- If not off-grid, `adj_value` equals value of that adj character
- `adj_value` is a symbol if `adj_value` is not:
    - a digit
    - a `.`
- when `adj_value` is a symbol, the flag gets set

### Creating the sum

```
curr_num *= 10;
curr_num += value.to_digit(10).unwrap();

if col + 1 >= grid[row].len() || !grid[row][col + 1].is_ascii_digit() {
    if has_adj_sym {
        sum += curr_num;
    }

    curr_num = 0;
    has_adj_sym = false;
}
```

Then, math happens:

- The first time a digit gets through, `0 * 10 = 0`
- Any other time after the first, the `curr_num` is shifted by an order of ten
    - Then, `value` is added to `curr_num`
- The for loops keep doing this until either:
    - end of line
    - not a digit
- If the flag is set, `curr_num` is added to the running sum

This is performed on all lines, until the end of the file. Then, the sum is returned.

## Part 2

Explanation of the code that solves part 2:

### Using a hashset and hashmap

```
let mut adj_star_positions: HashSet<(i32, i32)> = HashSet::new();
let mut stars: HashMap<(i32, i32), Vec<u32>> = HashMap::new();
```

In order to keep track of the positions of the stars (`*`), use a hashset.

In order to keep track of the coordinates of stars, relative to the numbers, use a hashmap.

### Adding star positions to hashset

```
for row_offset in -1..=1 {
    for col_offset in -1..=1 {
        if row_offset == 0 && col_offset == 0 {
            continue
        }

        let adj_row = row as i32 + row_offset;
        let adj_col = col as i32 + col_offset;

        if adj_row < 0
            || adj_row >= grid.len() as i32
                || adj_col < 0
                || adj_col >=grid[adj_row as usize].len() as i32
        {
            continue
        }

        if grid[adj_row as usize][adj_col as usize] == '*' {
            adj_star_positions.insert((adj_row, adj_col));
        }
    }
}
```

This time, if a number is next to a star, the coordinates of the star are added to the hashset.

### Adding numbers to hashmap

```
curr_num *= 10;
curr_num += value.to_digit(10).unwrap();

if col + 1 >= grid[row].len() || !grid[row][col + 1].is_ascii_digit() {
    for star in &adj_star_positions {
        stars.entry(*star).or_default().push(curr_num);
    }

    curr_num = 0;
    adj_star_positions.clear();
}
```

The math is very similar to the math in part 1.

However, this time, when the code reaches the end of either a line or a number, it will instead add the star coordinates and `curr_num` to the hashmap. Whether there was a star or not, both `curr_num` and the adjacent star coordinates are dropped.

### Getting the gear ratios

```
stars
    .values()
    .filter(|numbers| numbers.len() == 2)
    .map(|numbers| numbers[0] * numbers[1])
    .sum()
```

Once the file ends, the hashmap is then reviewed. Coordinates for the stars are filtered based on how many numbers are keyed to them. If there are two numbers for the same coordinate, the numbers are multipled together to get the "gear ratios". Those "gear ratios" are then summed to get the final total, which is returned by the function.
